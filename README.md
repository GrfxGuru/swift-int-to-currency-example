# Swift to Int to Currency Converter Example

This is an example of converting an entered string to an integer and then currency in response to a Reddit question.
You can find the question on [Reddit here](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/c5ttl6/new_to_swift_trying_to_make_a_simple_app_to_count/)

Enter a value in the text field and hit the convert button. This calls a function that will perform the conversation and return a string to be used for display.
